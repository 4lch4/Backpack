# @4lch4/backpack

This repository is home to a NodeJS package that provides a variety of functions, constants, etc., that I find useful and use in many of my projects.

## Constants

The following are folders of constants, each of which contains a variety of helpful values I use in my projects.

### Time

The `time` folder contains constants related to time, such as the number of milliseconds in a second, minute, hour, day, week, month, and year.

### Log

The `log` folder contains constants related to logging, such as the default service/app name to use, colors for output, and whatever else I want to add.

### Env

The `env` folder contains constants related to environment variables, such as the names of environment variables I use in my projects.

## Vendors

As of `v1.0.0`, `@4lch4/backpack/vendors` exports the following:

- `dayjs` as `Day`
- `picocolors` as `pc`
